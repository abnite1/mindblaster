Do you find it difficult to get your children to study? Hard to motivate them to do their homework? Well get ready for the ultimate in educational gaming as an old classic is revamped with a unique spin! Based on the arcade cult classic "Asteroids", **MindBlaster** combines classic gameplay with updated graphics & sound in a new educational experience unlike anything before it!

Geared at the elementary school level, grades 2-6, **MindBlaster**  players use unique profiles and custom spaceships as they battle hoards of asteroids and compete with friends for high scores, completion percentage and hidden bonuses. Players navigate through multiple styles of games all following basic elementary level curriculum. **MindBlaster** contains two types of games: ABC's, Counting and Spelling where players shoot asteroids in specific order and Math or Trivia games where players shoot the correct asteroid answer.

Progress and Scoring are automatically uploaded to and stored on the **MindBlaster** WebServer for access by both teachers and parents as an indication of players learning progress. Administators can also post rankings for encouragement and to reward successful learning.

With varying levels of difficulty for each game, hidden bonuses and exceptional educational content, **MindBlaster** perfectly balances study and play â€“ they won't even know they're learning!

Coming Soon: Customized Curriculum! Enhanced animation! Superior AI!
